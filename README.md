## Configuration

### Adding PiKVM Integration via Home Assistant UI

1. Go to the Home Assistant UI.
2. Navigate to **Configuration** -> **Devices & Services**.
3. Click the **Add Integration** button.
4. Search for "PiKVM".
5. Follow the setup wizard to configure your PiKVM device.

### Configuration Options

## Script for Development

A script is included to automatically link the repository to the correct directory for development. This script will run when you open the workspace.

Script: `.vscode/scripts/link-repository.sh`

``` sh
#!/bin/sh

# Check if /config/custom_components directory exists
if [ ! -d /config/custom_components ]; then
  echo "cannot find custom components directory"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if /config/custom_components/pikvm folder already exists
if [ -d /config/custom_components/pikvm ]; then
  echo "/config/custom_components/pikvm folder already exists"
  exit 1
fi

# Unlink /config/custom_components/pikvm if it's a symbolic link
if [ -L /config/custom_components/pikvm ]; then
  unlink /config/custom_components/pikvm
fi

# Check if custom_components directory exists in the current workspace
if [ ! -d custom_components ]; then
  echo "this must be run from the root of the pikvm workspace"
  exit 1
fi

# Create symbolic link
ln -s "$(pwd)/custom_components/pikvm" /config/custom_components/pikvm
echo "Linking Successful"
```

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure your PiKVM device is accessible from your Home Assistant instance.
